## Module `pennylane/drawer/drawable_layers.py`

This module contains a helper function to sort operations into layers.

## `drawable_layers`

```python
def drawable_layers(operations, wire_map=None, bit_map=None)
```

Determine non-overlapping yet dense placement of operations into layers for drawing.

Args:
    operations (Iterable[~.Operator]): A list of operations.

Keyword Args:
    wire_map (dict): A map from wire label to non-negative integers. Defaults to None.
    bit_map (dict): A map containing mid-circuit measurements used for classical conditions
        or collecting statistics as keys. Defaults to None.

Returns:
    (list[set[~.Operator]], list[set[~.MeasurementProcess]]) : Each index is a set of operations
    for the corresponding layer in both lists. The first list corresponds to the operation layers,
    and the second corresponds to the measurement layers.

**Details**

The function recursively pushes operations as far to the left (lowest layer) possible
*without* altering order.

From the start, the function cares about the locations the operation altered
during a drawing, not just the wires the operation acts on. An "occupied" wire
refers to a wire that will be altered in the drawing of an operation.
Assuming wire ``1`` is between ``0`` and ``2`` in the ordering, ``qp.CNOT(wires=(0,2))``
will also "occupy" wire ``1``.  In this scenario, an operation on wire ``1``, like
``qp.X(1)``, will not be pushed to the left
of the ``qp.CNOT(wires=(0,2))`` gate, but be blocked by the occupied wire. This preserves
ordering and makes placement more intuitive.

The ``wire_order`` keyword argument used by user facing functions like :func:`~.draw` maps position
to wire label.   The ``wire_map`` keyword argument used here maps label to position.
The utility function :func:`~.circuit_drawer.utils.convert_wire_order` can perform this
transformation.
