## Module `pennylane/ftqc/utils.py`

This module contains utility data-structures and algorithms supporting functionality in the
ftqc module.

## `parity`

```python
def parity(*args)
```

Get the parity of the arguments

## `QubitMgr`

```python
class QubitMgr
```

The ``QubitMgr`` object maintains a list of active and inactive qubit wire indices used and for use
during execution of a workload. Its purpose is to allow tracking of free qubit indices that
are in the :math:`\vert 0 \rangle` state to participate in MCM-based workloads, under the assumption of reset
upon measurement. Qubit wires indices will be tracked with a monotonically increasing set
of values, starting from the initial input ``start_idx``.

Args:
    num_qubits (int): Total number of wire indices to track.
    start_idx (int): Starting index of wires to track. Defaults to 0.

**Example:**
    The following MBQC example workload uses the ``QubitMgr`` to assist with recycling of indices
    between iterations

    .. code-block:: python

        from pennylane.ftqc import QubitGraph, diagonalize_mcms, generate_lattice, measure_x, measure_y
        dev = qp.device('null.qubit')

        @qp.qnode(dev, mcm_method="one-shot")
        def circuit_mbqc(start_state, angles):
            q_mgr = QubitMgr(num_qubits=5, start_idx=0)
            input_idx = q_mgr.acquire_qubit()

            # prep input node
            qp.StatePrep(start_state, wires=[input_idx])

            # prep and consume graph state iteratively
            for i in range(num_iter):
                # Acquire 4 free qubit indices
                graph_wires = q_mgr.acquire_qubits(4)

                # Denote the index for the final output state
                output_idx = graph_wires[-1]

                # Prepare the state
                qp.ftqc.GraphStatePrep(lattice.graph, wires=graph_wires)

                # entangle input and graph using first qubit
                qp.CZ([input_idx, graph_wires[0]])

                # MBQC Z rotation: X, X, +/- angle, X
                # Reset operations allow qubits to be returned to the pool
                m0 = measure_x(input_idx, reset=True)
                m1 = measure_x(graph_wires[0], reset=True)
                m2 = cond_measure(m1, partial(measure, angle=angle, reset=True), partial(measure, angle=-angle, reset=True))(plane="XY", wires=graph_wires[1])
                m3 = measure_x(graph_wires[2], reset=True)

                # corrections based on measurement outcomes
                qp.cond((m0+m2)%2, qp.Z)(graph_wires[3])
                qp.cond((m1+m3)%2, qp.X)(graph_wires[3])

                # The input qubit can be freed and the output qubit becomes the next iteration's input
                q_mgr.release_qubit(input_idx)
                input_idx = output_idx

                # We can now free all but the last qubit, which has become the new input_idx
                q_mgr.release_qubits(graph_wires[0:-1])

            # Perform the measurements on the output qubit from the last iteration
            return qp.expval(X(output_idx)), qp.expval(Y(output_idx)), qp.expval(Z(output_idx))

    For each loop iteration, the measured and reset wire labels are returned to the ``QubitMgr`` instance, which are then reallocated
    on the next step, which when combined with the MCM resets allows for qubit index recycling.

### `num_qubits`

```python
def num_qubits(self) -> int
```

Defines the total number of wire indices tracked by the manager.

Returns:
    int: total number of qubit wire indices

### `active`

```python
def active(self) -> set
```

Defines the active wire indices. Any wire index in this set is unavailable for use, as it may
be participating in existing algorithms and/or not be in a reset state.

Returns:
    set[int]: active wire indices

### `inactive`

```python
def inactive(self) -> set
```

Defines the inactive wire indices. Any wire index in this set is available for use, and is
assumed to be in a reset (:math:`\vert 0 \rangle`) state.

Returns:
    set[int]: inactive wire indices

### `all_qubits`

```python
def all_qubits(self) -> set
```

Defines all active and inactive wire indices.

Returns:
    set[int]: union of active and inactive wire indices

### `acquire_qubit`

```python
def acquire_qubit(self) -> int
```

Acquires an available qubit wire index from the inactive pool, and makes it active.
If there are no inactive qubits available a RuntimeError will be raised.

Returns:
    int: newly activated qubit wire index

### `acquire_qubits`

```python
def acquire_qubits(self, num_qubits: int) -> list[int]
```

Acquires num_qubits qubit wire indices from the inactive pool, and makes them active.
If there are no inactive qubits available a RuntimeError will be raised.

.. seealso:: :meth:`~.QubitMgr.acquire_qubit`.

Returns:
    list[int]: newly activated qubit wire indices

### `release_qubit`

```python
def release_qubit(self, idx: int) -> None
```

Release an active qubit wire index, idx, from the active pool, and makes it inactive.
If idx is not in the active pool a RuntimeError will be raised.

### `release_qubits`

```python
def release_qubits(self, indices: list[int]) -> None
```

Release the list of active qubit wire indices, indices, from the active pool, and makes them inactive.
If any of the given indices are not in the active pool a RuntimeError will be raised.

.. seealso:: :meth:`~.QubitMgr.release_qubit`.

### `reserve_qubit`

```python
def reserve_qubit(self, idx: int) -> None
```

Explicitly reserve the qubit wire index, idx, to be active.
If given index is not in the active pool a RuntimeError will be raised.
