## Module `pennylane/gradients/parameter_shift_hessian.py`

This module contains functions for computing the parameter-shift hessian
of a qubit-based quantum tape.

## `expval_hessian_param_shift`

```python
def expval_hessian_param_shift(tape, argnum, method_map, diagonal_shifts, off_diagonal_shifts, f0)
```

Generate the Hessian tapes that are used in the computation of the second derivative of a
quantum tape, using analytical parameter-shift rules to do so exactly. Also define a
post-processing function to combine the results of evaluating the tapes into the Hessian.

Args:
    tape (.QuantumTape): quantum tape to differentiate
    argnum (array_like[bool]): Parameter indices to differentiate
        with respect to, in form of a two-dimensional boolean ``array_like`` mask.
    method_map (dict[int, string]): The differentiation method to use for each trainable
        parameter. Can be "A" or "0", where "A" is the analytical parameter shift rule
        and "0" indicates a 0 derivative (the parameter does not affect the tape's output).
    diagonal_shifts (list[tuple[int or float]]): List containing tuples of shift values
        for the Hessian diagonal.
        If provided, one tuple of shifts should be given per trainable parameter
        and the tuple length should match the number of frequencies for that parameter.
        If unspecified, equidistant shifts are used.
    off_diagonal_shifts (list[tuple[int or float]]): List containing tuples of shift
        values for the off-diagonal entries of the Hessian.
        If provided, one tuple of shifts should be given per trainable parameter
        and the tuple should match the number of frequencies for that parameter.
        The combination of shifts into bivariate shifts is performed automatically.
        If unspecified, equidistant shifts are used.
    f0 (tensor_like[float] or None): Output of the evaluated input tape. If provided,
        and the Hessian tapes include the original input tape, the 'f0' value is used
        instead of evaluating the input tape, reducing the number of device invocations.

Returns:
    tuple[list[QuantumTape], function]: A tuple containing a
    list of generated tapes, together with a post-processing
    function to be applied to the results of the evaluated tapes
    in order to obtain the Hessian matrix.

## `contract_qjac_with_cjac`

```python
def contract_qjac_with_cjac(qhess, cjac, tape)
```

Contract a quantum Jacobian with a classical preprocessing Jacobian.

## `param_shift_hessian`

```python
def param_shift_hessian(tape: QuantumScript, argnum=None, diagonal_shifts=None, off_diagonal_shifts=None, f0=None) -> tuple[QuantumScriptBatch, PostprocessingFn]
```

Transform a circuit to compute the parameter-shift Hessian with respect to its trainable
parameters. This is the Hessian transform to replace the old one in the new return types system

Use this transform to explicitly generate and explore parameter-shift circuits for computing
the Hessian of QNodes directly, without computing first derivatives.

For second-order derivatives of more complicated cost functions, please consider using your
chosen autodifferentiation framework directly, by chaining gradient computations:

>>> qp.jacobian(qp.grad(cost))(weights)

Args:
    tape (QNode or QuantumTape): quantum circuit to differentiate
    argnum (int or list[int] or array_like[bool] or None): Parameter indices to differentiate
        with respect to. If not provided, the Hessian with respect to all
        trainable indices is returned. Note that the indices refer to tape
        parameters both if ``tape`` is a tape, and if it is a QNode. If an ``array_like``
        is provided, it is expected to be a symmetric two-dimensional Boolean mask with
        shape ``(n, n)`` where ``n`` is the number of trainable tape parameters.
    diagonal_shifts (list[tuple[int or float]]): List containing tuples of shift values
        for the Hessian diagonal. The shifts are understood as first-order derivative
        shifts and are iterated to obtain the second-order derivative.
        If provided, one tuple of shifts should be given per trainable parameter
        and the tuple length should match the number of frequencies for that parameter.
        If unspecified, equidistant shifts are used.
    off_diagonal_shifts (list[tuple[int or float]]): List containing tuples of shift
        values for the off-diagonal entries of the Hessian.
        If provided, one tuple of shifts should be given per trainable parameter
        and the tuple should match the number of frequencies for that parameter.
        The combination of shifts into bivariate shifts is performed automatically.
        If unspecified, equidistant shifts are used.
    f0 (tensor_like[float] or None): Output of the evaluated input tape. If provided,
        and the Hessian tapes include the original input tape, the 'f0' value is used
        instead of evaluating the input tape, reducing the number of device invocations.

Returns:
    qnode (QNode) or tuple[List[QuantumTape], function]:

    The transformed circuit as described in :func:`qp.transform <pennylane.transform>`. Executing this circuit
    will provide the Hessian in the form of a tensor, a tuple, or a nested tuple depending upon the number
    of trainable QNode arguments, the output shape(s) of the input QNode itself, and the usage of shot vectors
    in the QNode execution.


    Note: By default a QNode with the keyword ``hybrid=True`` computes derivatives with respect to
    QNode arguments, which can include classical computations on those arguments before they are
    passed to quantum operations. The "purely quantum" Hessian can instead be obtained with
    ``hybrid=False``, which is then computed with respect to the gate arguments and produces a
    result of shape ``(*QNode output dimensions, # gate arguments, # gate arguments)``.

**Example**

Applying the Hessian transform to a QNode computes its Hessian tensor.
This works best if no classical processing is applied within the
QNode to operation parameters.

>>> dev = qp.device("default.qubit")
>>> @qp.qnode(dev)
... def circuit(x):
...     qp.RX(x[0], wires=0)
...     qp.CRY(x[1], wires=[0, 1])
...     return qp.expval(qp.Z(0) @ qp.Z(1))

>>> x = np.array([0.5, 0.2], requires_grad=True)
>>> qp.gradients.param_shift_hessian(circuit)(x)
((array(-0.86883595), array(0.04762358)),
 (array(0.04762358), array(0.05998862)))

.. details::
    :title: Usage Details

    The Hessian transform can also be applied to a quantum tape instead of a QNode, producing
    the parameter-shifted tapes and a post-processing function to combine the execution
    results of these tapes into the Hessian:

    >>> tape = qp.workflow.construct_tape(circuit)(x)
    >>> hessian_tapes, postproc_fn = qp.gradients.param_shift_hessian(tape)
    >>> len(hessian_tapes)
    13
    >>> all(isinstance(tape, qp.tape.QuantumTape) for tape in hessian_tapes)
    True
    >>> postproc_fn(qp.execute(hessian_tapes, dev, None))
    ((array(-0.86883595), array(0.04762358)),
     (array(0.04762358), array(0.05998862)))

    The Hessian tapes can be inspected via their draw function, which reveals the different
    gate arguments generated from parameter-shift rules (we only draw the first four out of
    all 13 tapes here):

    >>> for h_tape in hessian_tapes[0:4]:
    ...     print(qp.drawer.tape_text(h_tape, decimals=1))
    0: ──RX(0.5)─╭●───────┤ ╭<Z@Z>
    1: ──────────╰RY(0.2)─┤ ╰<Z@Z>
    0: ──RX(-2.6)─╭●───────┤ ╭<Z@Z>
    1: ───────────╰RY(0.2)─┤ ╰<Z@Z>
    0: ──RX(2.1)─╭●───────┤ ╭<Z@Z>
    1: ──────────╰RY(1.8)─┤ ╰<Z@Z>
    0: ──RX(2.1)─╭●────────┤ ╭<Z@Z>
    1: ──────────╰RY(-1.4)─┤ ╰<Z@Z>

    To enable more detailed control over the parameter shifts, shift values can be provided
    per parameter, and separately for the diagonal and the off-diagonal terms.
    Here we choose them based on the parameters ``x`` themselves, mostly yielding multiples of
    the original parameters in the shifted tapes.

    >>> diag_shifts = [(x[0] / 2,), (x[1] / 2, x[1])]
    >>> offdiag_shifts = [(x[0],), (x[1], 2 * x[1])]
    >>> hessian_tapes, postproc_fn = qp.gradients.param_shift_hessian(
    ...     tape, diagonal_shifts=diag_shifts, off_diagonal_shifts=offdiag_shifts
    ... )
    >>> for h_tape in hessian_tapes[0:4]:
    ...     print(qp.drawer.tape_text(h_tape, decimals=1))
    0: ──RX(0.5)─╭●───────┤ ╭<Z@Z>
    1: ──────────╰RY(0.2)─┤ ╰<Z@Z>
    0: ──RX(0.0)─╭●───────┤ ╭<Z@Z>
    1: ──────────╰RY(0.2)─┤ ╰<Z@Z>
    0: ──RX(1.0)─╭●───────┤ ╭<Z@Z>
    1: ──────────╰RY(0.2)─┤ ╰<Z@Z>
    0: ──RX(1.0)─╭●───────┤ ╭<Z@Z>
    1: ──────────╰RY(0.4)─┤ ╰<Z@Z>

    .. note::

        Note that the ``diagonal_shifts`` are interpreted as *first-order* derivative
        shift values. That means they are used to generate a first-order derivative
        recipe, which then is iterated in order to obtain the second-order derivative
        for the diagonal Hessian entry. Explicit control over the used second-order
        shifts is not implemented.

    Finally, the ``argnum`` argument can be used to compute the Hessian only for some of the
    variational parameters. Note that this indexing refers to trainable tape parameters both
    if ``tape`` is a ``QNode`` and if it is a ``QuantumTape``.

    >>> hessian_tapes, postproc_fn = qp.gradients.param_shift_hessian(tape, argnum=(1,))
    >>> postproc_fn(qp.execute(hessian_tapes, dev, None))
    ((tensor(0., requires_grad=True), tensor(0., requires_grad=True)),
     (tensor(0., requires_grad=True), array(0.05998862)))
