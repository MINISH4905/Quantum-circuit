# Description of Grover's algorithm

In this section, we'll describe Grover's algorithm.
We'll begin by discussing *phase query gates* and how to build them, followed by the description of Grover's algorithm itself.
Finally, we'll briefly discuss how this algorithm is naturally applied to searching.

## Phase query gates

Grover's algorithm makes use of operations known as *phase query gates*.
In contrast to an ordinary query gate $U_f,$ defined for a given function $f$ in the usual way described previously, a phase query gate for the function $f$ is defined as

$$
Z_f \vert x\rangle = (-1)^{f(x)} \vert x\rangle
$$

for every string $x\in\Sigma^n.$

The operation $Z_f$ can be implemented using one query gate $U_f$ as this diagram suggests:

![A quantum circuit implementing a Z_f gate using one query gate together with the phase kickback phenomenon](/learning/images/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/grover-algorithm/Z_f.svg)

This implementation makes use of the phase kickback phenomenon, and requires that one workspace qubit, initialized to a $\vert -\rangle$ state, is made available.
This qubit remains in the $\vert - \rangle$ state after the implementation has completed, and can be reused (to implement subsequent $Z_f$ gates, for instance) or simply discarded.

In addition to the operation $Z_f,$ we will also make use of a phase query gate for the $n$-bit OR function, which is defined as follows for each string $x\in\Sigma^n.$

$$
\mathrm{OR}(x) =
\begin{cases}
  0 & x = 0^n\\[0.5mm]
  1 & x \neq 0^n
\end{cases}
$$

Explicitly, the phase query gate for the $n$-bit OR function operates like this:

$$
Z_{\mathrm{OR}} \vert x\rangle
= \begin{cases}
  \vert x\rangle & x = 0^n \\[0.5mm]
- \vert x\rangle & x \neq 0^n.
\end{cases}
$$

To be clear, this is how $Z_{\mathrm{OR}}$ operates on standard basis states; its behavior on arbitrary states is determined from this expression by linearity.

The operation $Z_{\mathrm{OR}}$ can be implemented as a quantum circuit by beginning with a Boolean circuit for the OR function, then constructing a $U_{\mathrm{OR}}$ operation (that is, a standard query gate for the $n$-bit OR function) using the procedure described in the *Quantum algorithmic foundations* lesson, and finally a $Z_{\mathrm{OR}}$ operation using the phase kickback phenomenon as described above.
Notice that the operation $Z_{\mathrm{OR}}$ has no dependence on the function $f$ and can therefore be implemented by a quantum circuit having no query gates.

## Description of the algorithm

Now that we have the two operations $Z_f$ and $Z_{\mathrm{OR}},$ we can describe Grover's algorithm.

The algorithm refers to a number $t,$ which is the number of *iterations* it performs (and therefore the number of *queries* to the function $f$ it requires).
This number $t$ isn't specified by Grover's algorithm as we're describing it, and we'll discuss later in the lesson how it can be chosen.

<Figure title="Grover's algorithm">
1. Initialize an $n$ qubit register $\mathsf{Q}$ to the all-zero state $\vert 0^n \rangle$ and then apply a Hadamard operation to each qubit of $\mathsf{Q}.$
2. Apply $t$ times the unitary operation $G = H^{\otimes n} Z_{\mathrm{OR}} H^{\otimes n} Z_f$ to the register $\mathsf{Q}$
3. Measure the qubits of $\mathsf{Q}$ with respect to standard basis measurements and output the resulting string.

The operation $G = H^{\otimes n} Z_{\mathrm{OR}} H^{\otimes n} Z_f$ iterated in step 2 will be called the *Grover operation* throughout the remainder of this lesson.
Here is a quantum circuit representation of the Grover operation when $n=7\!:$

In this diagram, the $Z_f$ operation is depicted as being larger than $Z_{\mathrm{OR}}$ as an informal visual clue to suggest that it is likely to be the more costly operation.
In particular, when we're working within the query model, $Z_f$ requires one query while $Z_{\mathrm{OR}}$ requires no queries.
If instead we have a Boolean circuit for the function $f,$ and then convert it to a quantum circuit for $Z_f,$ we can reasonably expect that the resulting quantum circuit will be larger and more complicated than one for $Z_{\mathrm{OR}}.$

Here's a diagram of a quantum circuit for the entire algorithm when $n=7$ and $t=3.$
For larger values of $t$ we can simply insert additional instances of the Grover operation immediately before the measurements.

## Application to search

Grover's algorithm can be applied to the *Search* problem as follows:

- Choose the number $t$ in step 2. (This is discussed later in the lesson.)
- Run Grover's algorithm on the function $f,$ using whatever choice we made for $t,$ to obtain a string $x\in\Sigma^n.$
- Query the function $f$ on the string $x$ to see if it's a valid solution:
  - If $f(x) = 1,$ then we have found a solution, so we can stop and output $x.$
  - Otherwise, if $f(x) = 0,$ then we can either run the procedure again, possibly with a different choice for $t,$ or we can decide to give up and output "no solution."

Once we've analyzed how Grover's algorithm works, we'll see that by taking $t = O(\sqrt{N}),$ we obtain a solution to our search problem (if one exists) with high probability.
