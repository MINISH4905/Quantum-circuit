# Qiskit implementation

In the previous lesson, we took a first look at the `Statevector` and `Operator` classes in Qiskit, and used them to simulate operations and measurements on single qubits.
In this section, we'll use these classes to explore the behavior of multiple qubits.

```python
from qiskit import __version__

print(__version__)
```

We'll start by importing the `Statevector` and `Operator` classes, as well as the square root function from `NumPy`.
Hereafter, generally speaking, we'll take care of all of our required imports first within each lesson.

```python
from qiskit.quantum_info import Statevector, Operator
from numpy import sqrt
```

## Tensor products

The `Statevector` class has a `tensor` method, which returns the tensor product of that `Statevector` with another, given as an argument.
The argument is interpreted as the tensor factor on the right.

For example, below we create two state vectors representing $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1\rangle,$ and use the `tensor` method to create a new vector, $\vert \psi\rangle = \vert 0\rangle \otimes \vert 1\rangle.$
Notice here that we're using the `from_label` method to define the states $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1\rangle,$ rather than defining them ourselves.

```python
zero = Statevector.from_label("0")
one = Statevector.from_label("1")
psi = zero.tensor(one)
display(psi.draw("latex"))
```

Other allowed labels include "+" and "-" for the plus and minus states, as well as "r" and "l" (short for "right" and "left") for the states

$$
\vert {+i} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \vert 0 \rangle + \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} \vert 1 \rangle
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\vert {-i} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \vert 0 \rangle - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} \vert 1 \rangle.
$$

Here, "+", "-" or "right" and "left" come from the context of quantum mechanical spin, in which a component of spin may point to the left or the right in an experiment; it is not referring to the right-most or left-most qubit in systems of multiple qubits. Here's an example of the tensor product of $\vert {+} \rangle$ and $\vert {-i} \rangle.$

```python
plus = Statevector.from_label("+")
minus_i = Statevector.from_label("l")
phi = plus.tensor(minus_i)
display(phi.draw("latex"))
```

An alternative is to use the `^` operation for tensor products, which naturally gives the same results.

```python
display((plus ^ minus_i).draw("latex"))
```

The `Operator` class also has a `tensor` method (as well as a `from_label` method), as we see in the following examples.

```python
H = Operator.from_label("H")
Id = Operator.from_label("I")
X = Operator.from_label("X")
display(H.tensor(Id).draw("latex"))
display(H.tensor(Id).tensor(X).draw("latex"))
```

Again, like in the vector case, the `^` operation is equivalent.

```python
display((H ^ Id ^ X).draw("latex"))
```

Compound states can be evolved using compound operations as we would expect — just like we saw for single systems in the previous lesson.
For example, the following code computes the state $(H\otimes I)\vert\phi\rangle$ for $\vert\phi\rangle = \vert + \rangle \otimes \vert {-i}\rangle$ (which was already defined above).

```python
display(phi.evolve(H ^ Id).draw("latex"))
```

Here is some code that defines a $CX$ operation and calculates $CX \vert\psi\rangle$ for $\vert\psi\rangle = \vert + \rangle \otimes \vert 0 \rangle.$ To be clear, this is a $CX$ operation for which the left-hand qubit is the control and the right-hand qubit is the target. The result is the Bell state $\vert\phi^{+}\rangle.$

```python
CX = Operator([[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0]])
psi = plus.tensor(zero)
display(psi.evolve(CX).draw("latex"))
```

## Partial measurements

In the previous lesson, we used the `measure` method to simulate a measurement of a quantum state vector.
This method returns two items: the simulated measurement result, and the new `Statevector` given this measurement.

By default, `measure` measures all qubits in the state vector.
We can, alternatively, provide a list of integers as an argument, which causes only those qubit indices to be measured.
To demonstrate this, the code below creates the state

$$
\vert w\rangle = \frac{\vert 001\rangle + \vert 010\rangle + \vert 100\rangle}{\sqrt{3}}
$$

and measures qubit number 0, which is the rightmost qubit.
(Qiskit numbers qubits starting from 0, from right to left. We'll return to this numbering convention in the next lesson.)

```python
w = Statevector([0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0] / sqrt(3))
display(w.draw("latex"))

result, state = w.measure([0])
print(f"Measured: {result}\nState after measurement:")
display(state.draw("latex"))

result, state = w.measure([0, 1])
print(f"Measured: {result}\nState after measurement:")
display(state.draw("latex"))
```
