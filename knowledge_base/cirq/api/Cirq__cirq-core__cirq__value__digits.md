## `big_endian_bits_to_int`

```python
def big_endian_bits_to_int(bits: Iterable[Any]) -> int
```

Returns the big-endian integer specified by the given bits.

Args:
    bits: Descending bits of the integer, with the 1s bit at the end.

Returns:
    The integer.

Examples:

    >>> cirq.big_endian_bits_to_int([0, 1])
    1

    >>> cirq.big_endian_bits_to_int([1, 0])
    2

    >>> cirq.big_endian_bits_to_int([0, 1, 0])
    2

    >>> cirq.big_endian_bits_to_int([1, 0, 0, 1, 0])
    18

## `big_endian_int_to_bits`

```python
def big_endian_int_to_bits(val: int, *, bit_count: int) -> list[int]
```

Returns the big-endian bits of an integer.

Args:
    val: The integer to get bits from. This integer is permitted to be
        larger than `2**bit_count` (in which case the high bits of the
        result are dropped) or to be negative (in which case the bits come
        from the 2s complement signed representation).
    bit_count: The number of desired bits in the result.

Returns:
    The bits.

Examples:
    >>> cirq.big_endian_int_to_bits(19, bit_count=8)
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]

    >>> cirq.big_endian_int_to_bits(19, bit_count=4)
    [0, 0, 1, 1]

    >>> cirq.big_endian_int_to_bits(-3, bit_count=4)
    [1, 1, 0, 1]

## `big_endian_digits_to_int`

```python
def big_endian_digits_to_int(digits: Iterable[int], *, base: int | Iterable[int]) -> int
```

Returns the big-endian integer specified by the given digits and base.

Args:
    digits: Digits of the integer, with the least significant digit at the
        end.
    base: The base, or list of per-digit bases, to use when combining the
        digits into an integer. When a list of bases is specified, the last
        entry in the list is the base for the last entry of the digits list
        (i.e. the least significant digit). That is to say, the bases are
        also specified in big endian order.

Returns:
    The integer.

Raises:
    ValueError:
        One of the digits is out of range for its base.
        The base was specified per-digit (as a list) but the length of the
            bases list is different from the number of digits.

Examples:

    >>> cirq.big_endian_digits_to_int([0, 1], base=10)
    1

    >>> cirq.big_endian_digits_to_int([1, 0], base=10)
    10

    >>> cirq.big_endian_digits_to_int([1, 2, 3], base=[2, 3, 4])
    23

## `big_endian_int_to_digits`

```python
def big_endian_int_to_digits(val: int, *, digit_count: int | None=None, base: int | Iterable[int]) -> list[int]
```

Separates an integer into big-endian digits.

Args:
    val: The integer to get digits from. Must be non-negative and less than
        the maximum representable value, given the specified base(s) and
        digit count.
    base: The base, or list of per-digit bases, to separate `val` into. When
         a list of bases is specified, the last entry in the list is the
         base for the last entry of the result (i.e. the least significant
         digit). That is to say, the bases are also specified in big endian
         order.
    digit_count: The length of the desired result.

Returns:
    The list of digits.

Raises:
    ValueError:
        Unknown digit count. The `base` was specified as an integer and a
            `digit_count` was not provided.
        Inconsistent digit count. The `base` was specified as a per-digit
            list, and `digit_count` was also provided, but they disagree.

Examples:
    >>> cirq.big_endian_int_to_digits(11, digit_count=4, base=10)
    [0, 0, 1, 1]

    >>> cirq.big_endian_int_to_digits(11, base=[2, 3, 4])
    [0, 2, 3]
